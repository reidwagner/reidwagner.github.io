           I'm a DevOps software engineer looking for new, strictly development roles in software. Let me tell you about myself. I first learned computer programming at age 15 in a high school Java class. This course took us from "Hello, World" to creating multi-threaded chat clients and 3D video games (with <a href="http://jmonkeyengine.org/">JMonkey</a>) in a school year's time. The next summer, I interned at University of Michigan's Department of Material Science and Engineering. Here I learned Matlab and IDL and helped develop novel methods of visualizing multi-dimensional data. After this I primarily used code as a means for solving math problems. One of my proudest moments in high school was turning in a single page of answers stapled to printed Java code that I wrote to solve the lengthy Calculus assignment solving definite integrals via the trapezoidal rule.
           </p>
           <p>
           In college I continued to shift my focus towards Physics and Math. While I took a handful of programming classes, most of my computer science education fell in the intersection of the discipline with math, e.g. Discrete Mathematics or Numerical Analysis. While I still loved programming, it wasn't until graduating that I began to take a a keen interest in how the giant suite of technology that drives our lives actually works. While I worked in a Cosmology lab at the University of Minnesota Physics Dept., alongside studying for the physics GRE, I began to dive into computer science fundementals that my education did not cover. While I had a solid foundation in algorithms and data structures, I focused on learning the technology stack, specifications, and computer architecture that modern software is based on. 
           </p>
           <p>
           During this time I experimented with a broad range of technology. I learned about functional programming - employing type theory with Haskell and s-expressions with Scheme. I wrote MVC web applications with backends employing Python and Postgresql, and dynamic Javascript frontends. What stuck with me was a desire to burrow deeper into the foundations of these applications. Ultimately I found great joy in learning about operating systems and their implementations. I dove into the internals  of Linux device driver and C compilers. I learned the nuances of Makefiles and submitted <a href="http://eudyptula-challenge.org/">Eudyptula Challenge</a> tasks. I forayed into microcontroller and embedded domain by hacking on an <a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2013/01/18/stm32f4-discovery-toolchain-mac-os-x/">STM32f4 Discovery</a> board. I also found that focusing on this low-level domain greatly strengthened my comprehension of every level of abstraction above it.
           </p>
           <p>
           Ultimately I found that I was most invested in the creative and technical outlet of building software. Instead of applying to graduate school I applied to software engineering positions and got a great offer in DevOps at Thomson Reuters. This position allowed me to leverage my historical experience with Java and my interest in the Linux ecosystem, while teaching me so much more about software development. While the administrational domain skills I've learned from this position are valuable in any development role, especially "Full-stack", I'm interested in shifting into a position that allows me to more explicitely develop applications. I've outlined some of my particular interests but I can (and want to) dive into any domain.
